## **Summary: Protocols and One-Way Hash Functions**

### **Protocols**
- A **protocol** is a set of steps followed by two or more people to complete a task.
- The steps must be done in a specific order, and everyone involved must know and agree to follow the steps.
- Protocols solve problems related to security, like protecting information or verifying identity.

### **One-Way Hash Functions**
- A **one-way hash function** scrambles data into a short, fixed-length value called a **hash**.
- Once the data is hashed, it canâ€™t be turned back into the original form.
- Hash functions are used in **password security**, **digital signatures**, and **cryptocurrencies**.
  
- **How it works**:
  1. A user enters a password.
  2. The password is scrambled (hashed) by a server.
  3. The server checks if the hash matches the stored value to verify the user.

- **Types of hash methods**:
  - **Folding**: Splits the data, adds the parts, and uses a portion as the key.
  - **Digit Rearrangement**: Changes the order of digits and uses the result as the key.
