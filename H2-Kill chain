# Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains






# Intrusion Kill Chain Phases

1. **Reconnaissance**:  
   The attacker researches and identifies potential targets, often by gathering information from public sources like websites and mailing lists.

2. **Weaponization**:  
   The attacker creates a malicious payload, often embedding a remote access trojan (RAT) in common file types like PDFs or Microsoft Office documents.

3. **Delivery**:  
   The attacker transmits the weaponized payload to the target, commonly through email attachments, malicious websites, or USB drives.

4. **Exploitation**:  
   Upon delivery, the payload exploits a vulnerability in the victim's system, such as software bugs or user errors, to activate the malicious code.

5. **Installation**:  
   The attacker installs a backdoor or RAT on the compromised system to maintain persistent access.

6. **Command and Control (C2)**:  
   The compromised system connects to a server controlled by the attacker, allowing them to issue commands and control the system remotely.

7. **Actions on Objectives**:  
   The attacker now executes their primary goal, such as data theft, system disruption, or further lateral movement within the network.

# Defensive Strategies

The Intrusion Kill Chain model is valuable for defenders because it maps out the adversary's process, allowing for targeted defenses at each stage. Defenders can implement various strategies such as detection, denial, disruption, degradation, deception, and destruction.

### Examples of Defensive Actions:

- **Detection**:  
  Use systems like Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) or Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) to identify malicious activity.

- **Denial**:  
  Implement firewalls or patch vulnerabilities to block attacks.

- **Disruption**:  
  Utilize antivirus software or Data Execution Prevention (DEP) to interrupt the attack process.

# Measuring Effectiveness

The effectiveness of these defensive actions can be measured over time:

- **Track Evolution**: Monitor how responses to different phases of the kill chain have evolved.
- **Identify Gaps**: Use metrics to identify weaknesses and prioritize improvements.
- **Increase Attacker Costs**: A resilient defense forces attackers to invest more resources, making successful intrusions more difficult and costly.

# Conclusion

Understanding and interrupting the entire kill chain, rather than focusing on individual exploits like zero-day attacks, is crucial for building robust cyber defenses. By targeting each stage of the kill chain, defenders can increase the cost and complexity for adversaries, ultimately enhancing their organization's cybersecurity resilience.
