# x) Read and summarize

1. **Tor Still Works**: Despite attempts by the NSA, Tor is still secure. Most attacks target browser flaws or user mistakes, not Tor itself.

2. **Not Just for Criminals**: Tor is used by many people, like activists, journalists, and families, for privacy and security, not just criminals.

3. **No Military Backdoor**: Though it was originally funded by the US Navy, there’s no hidden backdoor. Tor’s code is open and checked by experts.

4. **No One Prosecuted for Running Tor Relays**: Running a Tor relay is legal in the US, and no one has been prosecuted for it.

5. **Easy to Use**: Tor is simple to use with the Tor Browser or Tails, a secure operating system.

6. **Not That Slow**: While Tor is slower than regular Internet, it’s faster now, and more relays can help speed it up.

7. **Not Perfect**: Tor can fail if used incorrectly, so it’s important to follow instructions and keep the software updated. 

### Here’s a brief summary of the **Shavers & Bair (2016) abstract**:

- **Tor enables anonymous communication** online, even for non-technical users.
- It’s not hidden but makes tracking users nearly impossible.
- **Forensic analysis** may struggle to uncover communications but can still find valuable artifacts.
- **Tor's anonymization is highly effective**, making it difficult to bypass. 

Keywords: anonymizing, anonymous, communication, forensic analysis.
