4. **No One Prosecuted for Running Tor Relays**: Running a Tor relay is legal in the US, and no one has been prosecuted for it.

5. **Easy to Use**: Tor is simple to use with the Tor Browser or Tails, a secure operating system.

6. **Not That Slow**: While Tor is slower than regular Internet, it’s faster now, and more relays can help speed it up.

7. **Not Perfect**: Tor can fail if used incorrectly, so it’s important to follow instructions and keep the software updated.
