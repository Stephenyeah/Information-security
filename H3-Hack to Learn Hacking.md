(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh7OrFVyDo0)

**Introduction:**
The speaker, a 21-year-old cybersecurity consultant and board member of Test Ser, introduces themselves and outlines their roles, focusing on their collaboration with Coar. Test Ser is a community promoting ethical hacking among young people, encouraging them to develop their skills legally.

**About Test Ser:**
Test Ser was founded as a community for young people interested in programming, hacking, and cybersecurity. It organizes events like meet-ups, open-source projects, competitions, and charity initiatives, such as donating computers to young enthusiasts. The organization also helps young people report vulnerabilities ethically and collaborates on projects like Cyber Crime Exit, aimed at understanding why young people engage in cybercrime.

**Statistics and Survey Insights:**
Data from Test Ser's survey highlights how young people get into cybersecurity: mainly through family influence, curiosity, and video games. Many start by bypassing restrictions or modding games. Contrary to the stereotype, young cybersecurity enthusiasts are diverse and not just "lonely nerds."

**Why Young People Misbehave Online:**
Three main motivations for youth cybercrime were identified: bad influences, attention-seeking, and fun. Factors include the thrill of breaking rules, peer pressure, and misconceptions about the anonymity and victimlessness of cybercrimes.

**Personal Story:**
The speaker shares their journey into cybersecurity, starting with curiosity-driven hacking during a lazy weekend. They stumbled upon a vulnerability in an app, which they chose to report instead of exploiting, receiving positive feedback from the company. This experience, coupled with supportive parents, steered them away from cybercrime.

**Good vs. Bad Interventions:**
Negative responses, such as punishment or legal threats, can drive young people further into cybercrime. Instead, positive reinforcement, support, and guidance can nurture their skills and direct them toward ethical paths.

**Advice for Parents and Corporations:**
Parents should recognize and cultivate their child's skills, finding constructive outlets like bug bounties or educational resources. Corporations should be welcoming to vulnerability reports, offer rewards, and provide contact points for ethical reporting.

**Support for Young People:**
Young people should seek communities like Test Ser or Next Gen Hack and access resources for learning, such as CTF competitions or online tutorials. Mental health support is also crucial, as many young hackers may struggle with personal challenges.

**Conclusion:**
The speaker emphasizes the importance of community and positive reinforcement in guiding young people's skills in cybersecurity. Supporting young hackers and providing clear pathways for ethical hacking can help prevent them from veering into cybercrime.
